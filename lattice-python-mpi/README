Based on Jens Pfau's Python scripts for his Physica A paper from

http://ww2.cs.mu.oz.au/~pfauj/physicaa2012/physicaa2012-python.zip

modified by Alex Stivala to paralleize on MPI system using mpi4py,

http://mpi4py.scipy.org/

and also this version simplified to remove social networks, migration,
etc. for use on simpler lattice Axelrod model, and addition of extra 
parameters for initialization, joint activities, noise, etc.
